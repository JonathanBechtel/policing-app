The service used to generate the model output that you see on the home page can also be accessed via API.  This might
be useful if you want to study the values generated more thoroughly or use it in your own project in some way.

Predictions are made available via two different endpoints, one to predict probability of arrest, and the other
to predict probability of being searched.

Here's information on how to use each:

<h4>Search Endpoint: <code>/api/v1/search</code></h4>
